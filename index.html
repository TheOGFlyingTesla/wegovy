              <li>
                <b>Eat small, frequent meals.</b>
                <div style={{ fontWeight: 400 }}>
                  Large meals can overwhelm the digestive system and worsen symptoms like nausea, bloating, and heartburn. Smaller, more frequent meals are easier to digest and help maintain steady blood sugar and energy.
                </div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Avoid fatty, spicy, or heavy foods.</b>
                <div style={{ fontWeight: 400 }}>
                  These foods can irritate the stomach lining, delay stomach emptying, and make nausea, diarrhea, or bloating worse.
                </div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Hydrate well—64 oz (1.9 L) water daily.</b>
                <div style={{ fontWeight: 400 }}>
                  Proper hydration supports digestion, reduces headache and fatigue, and is critical to prevent constipation. Extra fluids may be needed if you experience vomiting or diarrhea.
                </div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Use electrolyte drinks if vomiting/diarrhea occurs.</b>
                <div style={{ fontWeight: 400 }}>
                  Electrolytes like sodium and potassium are lost with vomiting or diarrhea. Replacing them prevents dehydration and maintains muscle and nerve function.
                </div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Stay upright after eating (at least 30 minutes).</b>
                <div style={{ fontWeight: 400 }}>
                  Lying down immediately after meals can increase the risk of acid reflux and slow digestion, both of which can make nausea and heartburn worse.
                </div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Rotate injection sites (abdomen, thigh, upper arm). Always use a new needle.</b>
                <div style={{ fontWeight: 400 }}>
                  Rotating sites prevents irritation, lumps, or skin changes. Using a new needle each time reduces pain and risk of infection.
                </div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Increase dietary fiber gradually.</b>
                <div style={{ fontWeight: 400 }}>
                  Gradual increases help your gut adjust, preventing bloating or gas. Sudden large increases can make constipation or bloating worse.
                </div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Stay physically active.</b>
                <div style={{ fontWeight: 400 }}>
                  Activity stimulates intestinal movement, helping prevent or treat constipation and fatigue.
                </div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Eat slowly and chew thoroughly.</b>
                <div style={{ fontWeight: 400 }}>
                  This reduces swallowed air and helps digestion, lowering the risk of bloating, nausea, and indigestion.
                </div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Limit carbonated drinks.</b>
                <div style={{ fontWeight: 400 }}>
                  Carbonation introduces extra gas into your digestive tract, which can worsen bloating and discomfort.
                </div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Avoid caffeine and alcohol if you have diarrhea.</b>
                <div style={{ fontWeight: 400 }}>
                  Both can irritate your digestive tract and worsen dehydration by increasing fluid loss.
                </div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Monitor and log side effects.</b>
                <div style={{ fontWeight: 400 }}>
                  Keeping a record helps you and your provider identify patterns, triggers, or persistent issues needing medical attention.

              </li>
